# SIMPLE PLATFORMER

![demo gif](./assets/portal-demo.gif)

I'm once again using SDL2 as the graphics API and writing this game in Zig.


## Why Am I Making Another Game?

I'm not good at game design and I need to try out various things to gain ideas for things to try and get ability to give a direction to the games I develop.


## Quick Start

Dependencies:

- Zig v0.11.0
- SDL2
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_mixer

Building:
```console
$ zig build run
```
