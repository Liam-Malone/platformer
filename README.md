# SIMPLE PLATFORMER

![demo gif](./assets/portal-demo.gif)

I'm once again using SDL2 as the graphics API and writing this game in Zig.

Maybe I'll use raylib next time... we'll see

## Quick Start

Dependencies:

- Zig v0.11.0
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf
- SDL2_mixer

Building:
```console
$ zig build run
```
